# WeatherApp
Basic Weather App - vanillaJS

This app is the second project, after the Github finder project, in Section 8: API projects of The Modern JS course by Brad Traversy (Udemy.com).

The API from wunderground.com no longer works, but I've included this in repository storage, as it is a good example how how to structure a small application, putting classes and their constructors into their own .js files, and how to link them to app.js and index.html files.

This app also shows how you don't need the likes of React for smaller apps, which can be built from vanilla JS, and how we can persist information and settings in the apps for when we open them again, storing them in local storage.
